# 📉∿ ModuTEC - Real-Time Modulation & Demodulation Monitor ∿📈

**ModuTEC** is a real-time monitoring and simulation tool that implements both **analog** (AM, FM) and **digital** (ASK, FSK) modulation and demodulation techniques.  
The system is developed in **Python** and provides interactive visualization of audio signals in  **time** domain.

## ✨ Features
- ⚡ **Real-Time Processing**: Monitor signals as they are modulated and demodulated.  
- 📊 **Waveform & Spectrum Visualization**: Clear plots for comparison between original and processed signals.  
- 🔄 **Multiple Configurations**: Run simultaneous simulations with different modulation setups.  
- 🧪 **Accuracy Evaluation**: Includes correlation metrics (≥70%) to validate demodulated signals.  
- 🖥️ **Desktop Interface**: Designed with PyQt for a smooth and interactive user experience.
